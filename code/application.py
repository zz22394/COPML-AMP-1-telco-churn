# # Part 6: Application

# This script explains how to create and deploy Applications in CML.
# This feature allows data scientists to **get ML solutions in front of stakeholders quickly**,
# including business users who need results fast.
# This may be good for sharing a **highly customized dashboard**, a **monitoring tool**, or a **product mockup**.


# This has to be here until DSE-16317 is fixed.

# Clicking on any row will show a "local" interpreted model for that particular customer.
# Here, you can see how adjusting any one of the features will change that customer's churn prediction.

#
# Changing the *InternetService* to *DSL* lowers the probablity of churn.
# **Note**: this obviously does *not* mean that you should change that customer's internet service to DSL
# and expect they will be less likely to churn.
# Imagine if your ISP did that to you.
# Rather, the model is more optimistic about an otherwise identical customer who has been using DSL.
# This information simply gives you a clearer view of what to expect given specific factors
# as a starting point for developing your business strategies.
# Furthermore, as you start implementing changes based on the model, it may change customers' behavior
# so that the predictions stop being reliable.
# It's important to use Jobs to keep models up-to-date.
